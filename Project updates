YO: I added this file for you. Please use this file to include the project proposal and future updates.

In this project I will be managing the inventory of an ecommerece clothing application. 

I would like the user to organize the inventory in 4 ways. Each of these are going to be used in a real application so I would like to understand the way in which they should work through this project. 



1) from most to least expensive
2) from least to most expensive
3) from smallest size to largest
4) from largest to smallest size

I am trying to find an algorithm for organizing a list of float numbers from greatest to least but am struggling with trying to find and insert and extractings method for arrays.
